### Installing on Mozilla Firefox

To load the extension into Mozilla Firefox:

{{< admonition info >}}
  Addons loaded into Firefox this way are temporary and must be reloaded every time the browser restarts. Because of this Chrome is recommended for working on addons, but addons are expected to work on Firefox.
