## What is an addon?
An addon is a userscript, userstyle, or combination of both that runs on the Scratch website or project editor when enabled. For example, the "Editor find bar" addon has a userscript that adds a find box to the editor, and a userstyle that styles that box.

## What is a userscript?
A [userscript](/docs/develop/userscripts) is a JavaScript file that is executed every time the user loads a Scratch page. They can modify the documentâ€™s HTML, add new buttons, customize Scratch editor behavior, and so much more.

## What is a userstyle?
A [userstyle](/docs/develop/userstyles) is similar to a userscript; you can specify URL patterns for them. However, userstyles inject CSS instead of JavaScript. They are often used along userscripts to style elements added by them, but they can also be used to style native Scratch elements. When that's the case, we usually call them "themes".
